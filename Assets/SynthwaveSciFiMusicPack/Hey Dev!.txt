Hi There!

Did you know that's actually my first pack? I made it free and got some downloads, i realize i could make the musics better, and more close to synthwave, so i rebuild some mistakes of the old ones, and name them. 

And i'm giving you more 5 new songs!

If you wanna support me, i would love if ou consider buying my synthwave pack with 20 songs and 27 sfx with more than 3 minutes each song.
